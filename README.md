| 1.       | Download the file ` TicTacToe.java ` from the ` Releases ` tab to the right.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2.       | Open the **COMMAND PROMPT** application. This can be done by using the shortcut: _WINDOWS_ + _R_ and typing _cmd_                                                                                                                     |
| 3.       | Once in the terminal, type ` java -version ` to make sure **Java** is properly installed. If your system doesn't recognize the _java_ command, you can install  it from <a href="https://java.com/en/" target="_blank";>this link</a> |
| 4.       | It's time to compile! Set the path to the ` Downloads ` folder (Or wherever it might have gone), and type ` javac Downloads\TicTacToe.java `                                                                                          |
| 5.       | If no errors were thrown, it's time to run! Type ` java Downloads\TicTacToe.java `.                                                                                                                                                   |
