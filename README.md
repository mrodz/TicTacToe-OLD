# Tic Tac Toe
This project was created for HyperSkill's Tic-Tac-Toe.  
Proper documentation can be found within the game's **help** menu, which goes over key features & syntax.

### Installing/Runtime

| Step (#) | Instructions (For WINDOWS) |
| :----:   |            :---            |
|    1.    | Download the file ` TicTacToe.java ` from the ` Releases ` tab to the right. |
|    2.    | Open the **COMMAND PROMPT** application. This can be done by using the <br/>shortcut: _WINDOWS_ + _R_ and typing _cmd_ |
|    3.    | Once in the terminal, type ` java -version ` to make sure **Java** is properly <br/>installed. If your system doesn't recognize the _java_ command, you can install  it <br/>at https://java.com/en/ |
|    4.    | It's time to compile! Get the path to wherever the download might have gone<br/>_(This assumes it's the ` Downloads ` folder)_, and type ` javac Downloads\TicTacToe.java `  |
|    5.    | If no errors were thrown, it's time to run! Type ` java Downloads\TicTacToe.java `. |
|    6.    | Enjoy the game! It's a **command prompt app**, and inputs are based in text. <br/>The in-game **help** menu goes over the game in more detail. |

There are no start-up parameters required; this project was merely to practice using recursion and to learn the basics of algorithms
